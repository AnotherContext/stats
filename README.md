Parametric and Non-parametric Models in Forecasting
========================================================

This is an adaptation of a view over forecasting time series with parametric and non-parametric models through number of interactive plots, with data supplied by R through Shiny in real- time. 



The aim of this project is to compare performance of parametric and non-parametric time series trend models, by means of simulation. The models to be compared include simple parametric trends such as polynomials and sinusoidal functions, more flexible random walk processes, and a real dataset example: London mortality rates for years 1st Jan 2000- 31st Dec 2005.



Method used to estimate the trends and make predictions on the generated time series data was Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation approach (INLA) and R-INLA program.
